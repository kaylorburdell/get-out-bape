	          <h2>So let's say you have an array and youd really like to see all the elements of it listed out in a string. Maybe you just wanna see the data a few times, maybe you want to see it infinitely. Either way the enumerable command you're looking for is cycle. Cycle calls for the block of each element n times or forever if you don't feel like defining it. See below for an example. <br>
	          <p align ="left">a = ["a", "b", "c"]<br>
a.cycle { |x| puts x }  # print, a, b, c, a, b, c,.. forever.<br>
a.cycle(2) { |x| puts x }  # print, a, b, c, a, b, c.</p>
