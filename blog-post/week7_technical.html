	          <h2><img src= http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png><br>In the comic above we see a parent who has not-so-subtely named her child a command which, when interpreted by most basic SQL database programs, will remove her child's entry from the database. There are different kinds of text that fields in databases are prepared to handle, so one must be careful to ensure that these fields dont interpret their contents as commands or code that should be run. Many simple script-kiddie exploits are passed around in this manner, as simple blurbs of code which, when accidentally ran by whichever program reads them, can be devastating. Make sure to isolate your and specify your data from the programs that run them or you might be next.</h2>
