	          <h1>REMEMBER ME: The fundamentals of computer memory</h1>
	          <h2>The basic concept memory is that it's a place where your computer stores information. Programs execute thousands or millions of commands a second and thus are storing and editing a lot of data, so they need not only places where they can keep this data until the calculations are done but also places to leave them when the process is done. RAM (Random-Access-Memory) is like your short-term memory. Shopping lists, addresses, things you're going to be referencing in the near future are stored here for relatively fast, current access. The slower, more long-term memory is stored on your HDD (Hard Dist Drive). These drives are generally slower and contain your operating system as well as the programs you run on them. While your RAM generally resets every time you turn your computer off, your HDD maintains the same data between sessions. </h2>
