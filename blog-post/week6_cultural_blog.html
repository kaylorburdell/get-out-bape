	          <h2> Am I a bad person if I say I don't feel as if <b>Stereotype Threat</b> has ever really played a part in my work/social/scholarly activities. I'm a caucasian who's lived around suburban as well as urban Atlanta, GA and while I've witnessed and experienced this phenomenon- I don't believe I've let it sway my decision-making. Maybe I need to make myself more aware of stereotypes to make sure that I'm not promoting them? <br>Am I totally blowing it on the obliviously racist white male stereotype? <br> Does making myself more aware of this problem fix it or agitate it? <br> Is this some kind of backhanded jab designed create issues where there weren't any before? <br> I try to do the things I think are right/acceptable regardless of the cultural or stereotypical implications because I don't think thats my battle. Take that as you may.
