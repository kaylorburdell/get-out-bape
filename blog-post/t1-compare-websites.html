	           <h2>Let's compare three websites guys</h2>
	                <h1>Twitch.tv</h1>
	                <img src="http://i2.wp.com/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/twitch-to-livestream-the-e3-event.jpg" >
	                <h3> Originally created as a gaming-based side-project of the livestreaming site Justin.tv, Twitch.tv has now eclipsed it's big brother and retains the title as the premier videogame streaming site. Recently, Amazon outbid Google to purchase Twitch for a cool 1 billion dollars. </h3>
	                <h1>Pandora.com</h1>
	                <img src="http://www.pandora.com/img/pandora-logo-splash-538x110.png" >
	                <h3> Oh my GOD what is that song? While Spotify is securing more and more of the markey everyday, Pandora still reigns supreme as the most widely used internet radio provider. With options to like, dislike and skip songs, create up to 100 of your own stations as well as subscribe to their premium ad-free service, Pandora offers a variety of listening experiences that cater to almost everybody. </h3>
	                <h1>NadotA.com</h1>
	                <img src="http://nadota.com/images/SeamusLight/misc/logo2.png" >
	                <h3> Have you ever wanted to be insulted by randoms on the internet based off of your ingame skill, voice, social status or more? Head on over to NaDotA.com to chit-chat with your favorite DotA personalities and learn just how many people your mom sleeps with when you aren't around.</h3>
	                <h1> THE COMPARISON </h1>
	                <h3> 	 I chose these sites because I am on each of them a lot, probably too much. All three sites have a basic topbar-based login portal which manages the user's profile and prefences. Both NaDotA and Twitch allow you to browse the site without logging in while Pandora insists you login, namely because it's all based upon your musical preferences. After logging in Twitch and Pandora extend sidebars to aid in controlling and interacting with the content you see. As far as the design goes, NaDotA and Twitch default to a white background while Pandora opts for one with their signature blue texture, but I'm fairly certain that you can customize each of the sites if you see fit. All sites rely on either first or third-party input to generate content, so the design is pretty strictly function-based with very minimal excess lines and only secondary pictures and textures which serve just to supplement the song/thread/stream youve chosen to participate in. Theres no real problems with navigation as the sites are very straightforward and clearly indicate the page you are on and the one you are considering moving to. I believe all of the sites offer some kind of premium option to eliminate ads or support the owners/streamers but I have not invested in any of them as I do not see a need to at the moment. All of these sites work fine without paying for them.
