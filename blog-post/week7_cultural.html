	          <h1>Mentorship - 4</h1>
	          <h2> I don't know where I would be without the teachers and mentors I've had along the way. This is not a journey one can make alone. Knowledge and wisdom meant to be shared and I'm very glad I've encountered characters along the way who've chosen to share theirs with me. In return, I've always tried to pass on what I know, as it can be just as instrumental in solidifying my knowledge of a topic as it is in creating it in another. </h2>
	          <h1>Honesty - 3</h1>
	          <h2> Similar to mentorship, being able to call something (or someone) as it is and offer a genuine, unbiased analysis of it is an art that seems to be slipping by the wayside. With the prevalence of the yes-man not to mention the constant reconfiguration of the internet to just to align with whatever interests you've shown, the feedback loop of "no, this is unacceptable" seems to have been severed as there appears to be more and more mediocrity and false camaraderie than ever before. Valid criticism is now hard to find, not only of one's work but of themselves.</h2>
	          <h1>Advice</h1>
	          <h2> If memory serves me well, the last thing I was asked advice on was "Should I bother taking the SAT this Saturday?" I believe this lines up with both of the values above, explicitly with the first and morally with the second. </h2>
	          <h1>Values and Stereotype threat</h1>
	          <h2> Thinking about my values is good as I try to meditate on them often to see where I stand in relation to where I'd like to. Stereotype threat has never been that big of an issue for me, but an honest approach to it should be fine. So far just listening to music or taking 20-30 minutes to myself to ponder has worked fine, I believe it will at DBC as well.</h2>
