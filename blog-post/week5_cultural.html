	          <h1>Scary people are on the internet</h1>
	          <h2>Working with others via the web can be amazing. Two minds in tandem tackling a fresh problem can often lead to unique and creative solutions, if not blooming friendships. The problem arises when one takes into account the open-ness (I'm not sure how to make this a word) that the internet tends to bring out. When youre rude or blunt to somebody without being near them in person, you don't get that immediate feedback of "whoa I just made somebody feel bad and now I feel bad too." Instead you're shielded by a screen and you are free to go on without moral/ethical/social penalty. The good news is none of the latter part of what I just discussed has happened at dbc. Everybody I've paired with so far has been very supportive while also remaining honest and geniune throughout the whole process. None of my sessions have been difficult as a results of my partner and for that I'm truly thankful. Knowing how to communicate directly with a cohortmate is extremely vital to the success of the cohort itself. As far as feedback goes- thats been a bit more obscure. The words seem to be a sort of judgement of your ability to versus your peers and just as nobody enjoys ratting out coworkers at a same paygrade, nobody really wants to be on record burning somebody who just tried to help them. While I'd say that I wish people were more honest and direct in those I don't think that will happen due to the abnormally high quality of people dbc picks out. I guess it's the best kind of problem to have, I just hope people don't have issues they aren't being made aware of. A key to actionable feedback is being honest, but I'm sure we will see more spectrum as we move on in these upcoming weeks. As for feedback I've received, I haven't seen anything too far out in left field. Most of it has been very predictable which is a good thing I guess. When writing feedback I come up with the same problems as I mentioned above, the balance of not wanting to hurt feelings while still saying something mixed in with how hard you know everybody else is trying creates a very sensitive atmosphere. I wonder how that changes when we start doing this for 14 hours a day.
