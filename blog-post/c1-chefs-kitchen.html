	           <h2> What I think about DBC so far...</h2>
	                <p> Originally I was a lot more nervous about DBC than I care to admit. The past few years havent exactly been overwhelming (or even whelming but whatever) so I was trying not to get my hopes up or get too invested in whatever I was planning to do next. This mentality was a mistake. Everybody I've met from DBC and everything I've seen has a very unique glow to it. It's so fascinating to see such a transparent, motivated group of people who really buy into the idea of being the rawest kind of awesome. I'm still anxious about workload, moving to NY and being thrown into a completely new environment, but seeing how highly everybody seems to regard the ethich and style of work done with DBC I've got 100% confidence that all I need to do is listen and work hard and things will end up fine. I look forward to meeting everbody in person and swan diving into all of this incredible experience.</p>
