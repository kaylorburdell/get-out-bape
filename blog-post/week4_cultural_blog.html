	          <h2> Net neutrality is the idea that all traffic on the web is created equal. Your videogame doesn't get any priority over some skype chat two wallstreet execs are having. Currently, pseudo-monopolies and web-aficionados are duking it out over the idea that larger corporations want the right to pay more to have more rapid content delivery. I don't think this that super of an idea because because of a few reasons. The main one is that even though the vast majority of content spewed out by non-corporate parties is mediocre at best, the fact that you can instantly get your content out on the web/twitter/social media for free and it can immediately be indexed and accessed is not only what makes the internet work, it's the principal internet is built on. If we transition into a premium-pay model for the internet, there will be content creators with big ideas but small pockets who won't be able to compete with larger opponents and will lose out regardless of how innovative their ideas are.
