	          	<h1> Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</h1><br>
	          	<h2>A few years back I had a pretty heated arguement with a roommate about how much noise he would make at certain parts of the day and how I only need him to be relatively quiet for a couple of hours each day.</h2><br>
 				<h1>What was the source of the conflict?</h1><br>
				<h2>A disagreement over what was an acceptable volume for music.</h2><br>
 				<h1>How did you handle that conflict?</h1><br>
				<h2>He decided he was being quiet enough regardless of what I said, so I begain to be overly loud during other parts of the day when it was clear he preferred the quiet.</h2><br>
 				<h1>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h1><br>
				<h2>Worse, which was the whole point.</h2><br>
				<h1>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h1><br>
				<h2>Probably pick a different roommate because we disagreed about a lot of other things and he was not a very clean person. However, I also agree that I intentionally aggravated the situation because I was not happy with it.</h2><br>
 				<h1>What did you learn from this experience?</h1><br>
				<h2>More flies with sugar than vinegar. Also to pick roommates who had more similar schedules.</h2><br>
