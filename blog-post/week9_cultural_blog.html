	          	<h1> How do I get to Franklin Avenue?</h1><br>
	          	<h2>Franklin Ave. is very long and has a number of twists and turns that I was not aware of. Instead of asking how to get to Franklin Ave. I should have asked for specific cross streets or addresses.</h2><br>
 				<h1>Which language is easier to learn?</h1><br>
				<h2>People have very different learning styles, knowing WHY or HOW a language is to learn is much more important than assigning an arbitrary number to its difficulty. </h2><br>
 				<h1>May I help?</h1><br>
				<h2>Rather than asking to help, ask HOW you can help. It goes a long way.</h2><br>
