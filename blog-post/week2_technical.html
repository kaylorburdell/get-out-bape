	          <h2> Most of y'all are familiar with yards, right? Well if you aren't this is going to be a very difficult concept for you but I'm going to assume you are. To start off, your content or whatever information you've put on your page is your house. It sits in the middle of the lot and is surrounded by your yard, a fence, and probably some more space past the fence. The distance between your house and your fence is referred to as the padding. Since were continuing this metaphor, your fence can easily be identified with the border because just like a border it seperates your stuff from your neighbor's. Past your border, I mean fence, is the margin which is akin to the area off your property that may still be yours but is used more to establish a buffer around your fence.
