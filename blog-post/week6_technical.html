	          <h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) vs. Functional Programming (FP) </h1>
	          <h2>Object-Oriented and Functional Programming are two different approaches to coding languages. The basic idea of <b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> is you create an object that is flexible enough to be expanded by adding more methods to it. OOP prioritizes composition and looks to have your specific method be contained. <b>Functional Programming (FP) </b> focuses on using inheritance and composing new functions to deal with specific tasks rather than wrapping them up with other methods. I don't think it's fair to say FP is the opposite of OOP, but OOP tends to be easier to compose and comprehend because of its visual style and relative ease when it comes to comparing the object to a real world model.</h2>
