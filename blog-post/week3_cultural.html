	       <h2>From the tests I took the category I landed in far and away was that of the concrete random thinker. Reading the description, its pretty spot-on as to how I approach most of my problems. Just like Ms. Frizzle on The Magic School Bus (what an awful reference) my whole montra is to get in there, make mistakes and get messy. Try whatever and see what sticks, then investigate why. This is pretty much the whole approach I've been taking to DBC and while I'm using elements from other quadrants to aid in the process, I've been primarily in this one. I totally understand and agree with the idea that to be good at something you need to be good at learning, and that strictly learning from my comfort zone will create deficiencies down the road which is why I'm working to push myself out of my experimental bubble and add more structure and reason to what I'm doing while not losing my main stream of thought. The only real problem I have/have had with work is that my schedule/work ethich aren't where they need to be. I was better about it this unit (for the most part) but I'm pretty sure I need to really lock it down in these next units before I go to NY.
