	          <h1>Classes in Ruby</h1>
	          <h2>I'm going to try to walk you through the basics structure of classes in ruby and what all the little symbols mean. Below I've created a simple doodad.<br>
	          <p align ="left" ><code>class dislike<br>
					def initialize(what, when)<br>
					@what = what<br>
					@when = when<br>
					end<br>
					def what<br>
					p @what<br>
					end<br>
					end<br></code></p>
					You see I am very busy and must keep a journal of all the things I dislike. This little method allows me to not only store what I dislike but can add the parameter of when I disliked it. For example I had a run-in with a nasty banana at the age of two that scarred me for life. To enter that, we could put<br>
					 <p align ="left" ><code>banana = dislike.new("banana", "1991") <br></code></p>
					Now instead of using my valuable brain space to remember stuff that is only relevant to me, I can remember other stuff like how many advil one can take before causing permanent liver damage. If I want to recall what I dislike, I can just write<br>
					<p align ="left" >a.what<br></code></p>
					and my lovely code will spit out
					<p align ="left" >banana<br></code>
					which is more pathetic than anything at this point because I've heard bananas are lovely and that I'm really missing out. Oh well. </h2>
