	       <h2>Javascript is popular for a few reasons. At this point, pretty much every browser on every platform has the ability to read and compile JS. The other really awesome part about it (besides the fact that its markdown and syntax is pretty simple) is that its one of if not the best way to display dynamic, remotely fetched content and implement it into a responsive design. Some of the drawbacks of JS are that it's not every optimized (it can span thousands of lines for relatively simple commands), there isn't much native security built in, it doesn't deal with authentication nor does it maniupulate media and adjust images as well as other, newer languages.
