	           <h2> What is pair programming?</h2>
	                <p> The process of collaborating with another developer to work as a team to provide programming solutions. </p>
	                
	           <h2> Why is pair programming important to DBC?  </h2>
	                <p> DBC wasn't designed to pump out codemonkeys. Instead, the program gears towards generating well-rounded coders who not only have an adept knowledge of what they're working on but who also understand the give-and-take involved in being in a collaborative, project-based environment.</p>
	                
	           <h2> Compare Driver and Navigator </h2>
	            <p> If the Navigator is the guy holding the map, the Driver is the one making the turns. While the former guides his partner through the goals the code is working towards accomplishing, the latter is responsible for implementing them.</p>
	           <h2> Reflections </h2>
	            <p> Pairing was less awkward than I thought it would be, even with the wild mic noise the Jamie was having. I was pretty tentative heading into it but afterwards am glad I did it. I'm looking forward to pair programming more as it aids in understanding code much more thoroughly.</p>
